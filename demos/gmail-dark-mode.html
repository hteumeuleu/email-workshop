			<p style="color:#000">
				With online workshops, we aim to give you the same experience and access to experts as in an in-person workshop, without needing to leave your desk. So you can learn at your own pace, in your own time, and follow interactive exercises along the way.
			</p>
			<p style="color:#000">
				Our workshops are all around front-end and UX, and they are structured differently, but all of them are packed with practical examples. You can also ask questions during dedicated Q&A time, and you'll get all workshop materials and recordings, too.
